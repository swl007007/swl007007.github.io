# Henry David Thoreau
I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,
to front only the essential facts of life,
And see if I could not learn what it had to teach,
and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.


# Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 NIV

There is a time for everything, 

and a season for every activity under the heavens: 

a time to be born and a time to die, 

a time to plant and a time to uproot,

 a time to kill and a time to heal, 
 
 a time to tear down and a time to build, 
 
 a time to weep and a time to laugh, 
 
 a time to mourn and a time to dance, 
 
 a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, 
 
 a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing, 
 
 a time to search and a time to give up,
 
  a time to keep and a time to throw away, 
  
  a time to tear and a time to mend, 
  
  a time to be silent and a time to speak,
  
   a time to love and a time to hate, 
   
   a time for war and a time for peace.


# Macbeth

Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
To the last syllable of recorded time;
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.


# tempus finitum, vis finita, solum necessarium.
